PURPOSE:
With the idea of helping businesses grow using their instagram account I built this project
This follows a strategy suggested by instagram itself for new business owners to grow their online presence.

EXAMPLE:
For example when you are starting a cooking account and want more followers, you can go ahead and open a famous cooking account page and
send a requests to all the followers of that famous page. When this happens those people recognize your account as they are also passionate
about cooking. This way they will recognize your account, and you will gain more followers.

ABOUT:
This python project uses selenium to run the Chrome browser that automatically logs you in to your instagram account using your credentials.
It opens up a similar account provided by you and follows all the accounts in that account's followers list by automatically scrolling down.
